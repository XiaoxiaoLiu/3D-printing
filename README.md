3D-printing
===========

This repository hosts a collection of 3D stl models that are extracted
from open medical images, using open source segmentation, surface modeling
tools such as ITK[1], VTK[2], Slicer[3], Paraview[4].

Currently, the one-piece visible human [4] skull model is available:
    final_skull_visible_female_full.stl
The final_skull_visible_female_full_decimated_smoothed.stl is only for
viewing purpose here (github only supports stl file < 10MB).
To better see the interior skull geometry, we also created a two-part model,
(a top cap and a bottom part) which can be found at:
